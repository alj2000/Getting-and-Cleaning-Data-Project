#Steps done in the R script
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.

5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Variables
1. x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test: These contain the data from the given file
2. x_data, y_data and subject_data: These merge the datasets.
3. features: The corrected actual values of the dataset(x_data)
